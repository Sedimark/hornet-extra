# hornet-extra (to be updated)
A private tangle instance is deployed on LINKS servers. The following instructions explain how to deploy and connect other nodes to the private tangle. 

---

## Requirements: 
- Software: `docker`, `docker compose`. 
- For hardware specifications refer to [Iota wiki](https://wiki.iota.org/hornet/getting_started/)

Clone github repository https://github.com/iotaledger/hornet.git or just download the private tangle [archive](https://github.com/iotaledger/hornet/releases/tag/v2.0.1).

```bash
mkdir private_tangle  
cd private_tangle  
wget https://github.com/iotaledger/hornet/releases/download/v2.0.1/HORNET-2.0.1-private_tangle.tar.gz
tar -xzf HORNET-2.0.1-private_tangle.tar.gz
```

Hornet nodes provide different tools, to make a list:
```bash
docker compose run hornet-extra tool -h
```

Each node can be uniquely identified by a peer identity. A new identity must be created for the node, which is necessary for recognition by other nodes. Essentially, a key pair is generated by the tool. The private key needs to be copied into `docker-compose.yml`, thereby altering the internal configuration of the node.

```bash
docker compose run hornet-extra tool p2pidentity-gen
```

Updated `docker-compose.yml` and `config_private_tangle.json` accordingly. Examples are provided. 

To start the node that will connect to the private tangle:
```bash
sudo ./cleanup.sh
sudo ./bootstrap.sh
docker compose up
```
